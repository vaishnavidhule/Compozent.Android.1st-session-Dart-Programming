## **Advanced Questions**

### **11. Class and Object**
Write a Dart program to create a class `Car` with the following properties:  
- `brand` (String)  
- `model` (String)  
- `year` (int)  

Add a method `displayInfo()` that prints the car's details. Create an object of the `Car` class and call the `displayInfo()` method.

**Expected Output:**
```
Car Details:  
Brand: Toyota  
Model: Corolla  
Year: 2020
```

---

### **12. Inheritance**
Write a Dart program to demonstrate **inheritance**. Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` that prints "Animal makes a sound". Create a derived class `Dog` that overrides the `makeSound()` method to print "Dog barks".

**Expected Output:**
```
Animal makes a sound  
Dog barks
```

---

### **13. Optional Parameters**
Write a Dart program with a function `greet` that takes two parameters: `name` (required) and `message` (optional). If `message` is not provided, default it to "Welcome".

**Example Call:**
```dart
greet("Alice");
greet("Bob", "Good Morning");
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hello Alice, Welcome  
Hello Bob, Good Morning
```

## **Bonus Question**

### **15. Palindrome Checker**
Write a Dart program to check if a given string is a **palindrome**. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. Test with the string "madam".

**Expected Output:**
```
The string 'madam' is a palindrome.
```

---

## **Solutions Hints**
1. Use `print()` for output.  
2. Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
3. Lists: Use `.add()`, `.sort()`.  
4. Sets: Use `.add()` and `.remove()`.  
5. Maps: Use `map[key] = value`.  
6. Sorting: Implement loops for Bubble Sort.  
7. Binary Search: Use iterative or recursive logic.  
8. Classes: Use `class` and `object` instantiation.  
9. Inheritance: Use `extends` for a subclass.  
10. Optional parameters: Use `[]` or `{}` for optional/ named parameters.  
11. Anonymous functions: Use `list.forEach()` with a lambda function.
